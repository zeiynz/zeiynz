I'm [**Zain**](), a software engineer from East Java, Indonesia.

I'm mainly interested in **Front-end development** and I recently completed my studies at [**@Bangkit Academy**](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/). ðŸš€

I am fascinated by building intuitive, user-friendly interfaces for large-scale, high-impact products. I have worked on services and applications in leading industries, with a focus on creating seamless user experiences. I have contributed to designing and launching major UI features, as well as optimizing systems for widely used, customer-facing platforms. 

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and make content.
